<h1>Top Star Wars Movies According to Me </h1>
<h2>Top 3 Star Wars Movies</h2>
<p>
<hr/>

<h3>Revenge of the Sith</h3>
<p>All the different plots that were created over the past 2 movies finally explain this movie in a realistic but unpredictable way.</p>

<h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>Connects both the first and third movies in an interesting way entertaining the viewer and leaving them interested.</p>

<h3>Rouge One</h3>
<p>Filler movie that connects and answers questions that viewers may have had during the Original Trilogy. </p>
